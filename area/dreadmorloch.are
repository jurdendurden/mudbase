Beginning Of A Dried Up Stream~
Mud cakes the ground everywhere. This is the beginning of what was a
mountain stream. What once was filled with beautiful flowing water has
completed dried into a thick brick like mud. Heat radiates from the ground
unnaturally almost cooking the ground like an oven.

As far as the eye can see is dry barren ground. The heat rising from the
ground is so incredibly hot that specs of glass can be seen among the dried

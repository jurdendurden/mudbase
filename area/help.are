mob names, object names: these should have every keyword in your short description, other
than words like: the, a, an, etc...
 
short descs: These are the things you see in combat, 'you swing at a kobold with an axe of
slaying'. We don't want to see things like: 'you swing at a kobold with an axe of slaying
lies here'.
 
Long descs: End these with a period. always. Also please capitalize the first word in them.
Be aware of things like: 'A key rests on the dirt ground here.' - What if they dropped it in
a tiled room?
 
 
Room descs: please try not to refer to characters using 'you' in room descs. Also try to remember
that there are things like day/night, seasons, etc. So you don't want to say something like: "A
[Hit Return to continue]
valley sprawls before you, the sun bringing it's natural beauty to light.", since it might be night.
Also try not to be repetitive with your room descriptions. Sometimes it's necessary, not always. Oh,

0 history~

Many millennia ago, when humans first discovered their abilities to space
travel, they began an extensive (and expensive) quest to colonize other
planets, galaxies and star systems. Their technology was limited, and it was
quickly realized that in order to branch out further than the known Solar
System, a new type of fuel or energy would be required to power their ships
faster and farther. 


After a few decades of research and inhumane experimentation, humans were able
to produce a new element from molecular combinations of plutonium, xenon, and
hydrogen. This new chemical had the atomic power of a 300-ton atom bomb, but
non of the explosive properties, making it extremely favorable as a fuel type.
The drawback, however, was that it's half-life was incredibly short, and the
fumes it exuded were extremely toxic to anything living on earth. 


After many more years of research and development, it was decided that the new
fuel was a viable alternative, provided that it was never used within Earth's
atmosphere. A craft was created to transport ANOTHER craft to the GHST (galatic
human space station, or commonly called 'ghost'). The transportee was a new
ship designed to use the new fuel, and this mission was successful. Once docked
with the GHST, the revolutionary new spacecraft was stocked with supplies and
humans, and sling-shotted into space. 


Two years passed, the ship hurtled through space, looking for a planet with an
atmosphere similar to Earth's. Finally locating one, the humans eased the ship
into the strange new planet's atmosphere, and made for landing. The following
three years they colonized, building a reasonable community in a planet quite
closely resembling earth. 


The colonists were ordered to return to Earth after 5 years and debrief, get
more supplies, and pick up more colonists, so once the time came, they left the
newfound planet. Upon return to the Milky Way, a computer update revealed the
location of Earth to be an empty, blank spot on the map. GHST still existed,
which is how they were still receiving computer updates, but everyone aboard
was dead. Apparently killed by some sort of airborne pathogenic mutating space
virus, the colonists were very careful while refueling their vessel with the
last bit of fuel left on board. 


Once the colonists had scavenged out GHST, they journeyed back to the new
planet. They ran out of fuel just as they hit the gravitational pull of this
new world... crash landing a couple hundred miles away from the original
colony. Wandering for some time, they eventually did find the original colony,
in a bad state of disrepair. Settling in again, they officially formed what is
now known as the city of Renfall. 


Unknown to the colonists, the ship's reserve tank was not empty, and the fuel
computer was simply malfunctioning. This cause a small amount of vapor from the
toxic fuel to waft into the atmosphere of what is now called Aragond. It was a
very trace amount, but over time mutated the humans who were growing in
numbers. Some grew shorter, getting hairier and stockier, while others simply
grew more slender, their features getting sharper and sharper (pointed ears,
angular faces). Others became deformed beasts of powerful strength with little
in the way of wits. 


The vapor also began creating 'anomalies' in nature... IE magic. Beings found
that they were able to harness mystical forces to cast spells, evoking
elemental fire or ice to rain upon their enemies. This lessened the need for
technology, which was scarce anyhow, since the knowledge of it was obscured and
lost over time.

Psions are a rare occurence in the world of Aragond. Adventurers
with unrecognized psionic potential may choose to address this,
and hone his abilities with another more skilled psionicist. This
usually costs a great deal of money, as much time is needed for
one to hone their mental abilities to an extent necessary to become
a true psionicist. Wild talents aren't unknown in Aragond, however,
and can be a wildcard in any battle.

This is a file to help new builders here get up to speed with some
of the ease of use features I've added to OLC, to help speed up the
building process and ensure you are able to spend your building time
making the environment seem more realistic through more advanced
things such as mob programs, object programs, quests, etc.
 
Commands:
COPY helps you copy object, room, or mobile information instead of retyping it.
IRESET helps you easily set up resets. doesn't support nesting however.
OLIST/RLIST/MLIST all show lists of objs/rooms/mobs in OLC
AUTOSET for mobiles.
ALLSECT sets all sectors in a given area.
ALLHEAL/ALLMANA sets all regen rates in an area.
ARESET shows all resets in the area.
CHECKWPN/CHECKTYPE filter objects in a list to compare them.

41 pc_immortal immortals~

Ok these are just some general guidelines of being an immortal here:
 
Be visible as much as possible please. I know there are times when
you can't, but yeah 90% of the time you should be visible.
 
Try not to be visible in the game world. If you need to, goto 101. It's
where I tend to hang out, heh.
 
If you have the power to spellup or restore or set double xp, please don't
unless it's a special occasion.
 
Newbie helping is a fine line. Their corpse is no longer hard to find so let's
not get into the habit of transferring people to it. However, we do need to
help them in certain areas (without giving away exact directions, actual objects, etc.)
 
Don't give out gold, objects, experience, guild points, levels, etc. without
my express permission.
 
Don't ever give people skills/spells/skill percentages/spell percentages.
I AM logging this, don't think you wont get caught. ;) I don't wanna
lose good immortal staff to the temptations of cheating heh.
 
Don't load eq for people. Right now in alpha it's ok to load the alpha tester
rings for people but other than that DONT DO IT. Once again, this is logged
for immortals so if you give eq to a player I will know about it.

a bank.
a weaponsmith (with an anvil in the shop)
an armorsmith (possibly also with an anvil).
a blacksmith, cobbler, peddler, bowyer, etc.. (basic medeival professions).
a cloth merchant (with a loom in the shop)
a jeweller (who sells jewelcrafting kits)
guilds for each class.
a food vendor
a drink vendor/fountain
a neighborhood
a bar
extra land for farms/docks (if nearby to a body of water)
a few empty houses. (for sale or abandoned)
a stables
a temple to some in game deity
 
 
 
 
Smaller cities/villages/towns will obviously not have some of these things,
but I'll leave these at the discretion of the builder. This is just a guideline
for making medium to large cities.

41 area guidelines~

Setting an area's primary resource:
 
Doing this will give the material you set it to a 25% bonus chance
of being harvested when a player does their mining, woodcutting, etc.
See help build for material restrictions.
 
Setting the climate:
 
Please make sure your area's climate is relatively close to the area(s)
next door to it. In some instances this may not be necessary, but in
order to create 'flowing' weather patterns, this is a requirement.
 
Setting an area's Faction:

Each area will be part of a bigger faction that will later allow players to
vie for land and resources. For now just make each zone part of the faction
of the nearest town. So far Renfall and Golthek are the only two factions.
 
Flagging the area as a 'ship' via area flags:

Use of this flag creates an area that is actually a ship. Ships will
need to have a 'stern' room, or basically a room where you can place
a ship's helm (this is an actual item type in OEDIT). Ship's helms are
required to make a ship operate. Also, the same room must have it's owner
flag set to the character who owns the ship, otherwise once again the
boat/ship will not act properly. Ships should never be more than 30 or so rooms.

0 death corpse~

Death is caused by, well, dying. When you die, you will be transported to
the healer in Renfall. Unlike most worlds, at this point you will be your whole
self, not any sort of ghostly form, mostly unchanged save for a loss of a bit
of experience. Normaly at this point one would pay the healer a sum of gold in
order to make use of the 'morgue' command and recover your lost corpse, should
you not be able to do it on your own. However, during the current alpha phases
of the game, your corpse will be transported to the High Priest of Renfall,
where it will await you, free of charge. The penalties and consequences of
death, and your ability to recover your belongings will be ever changing, stay
tuned. 

Dying to players can sometimes cause loss of consitution. When one's
constitution is reduced low enough, the player stands the risk of his character
permanently dying. 

A character can also die from aging, although this generally takes a very very
long time to happen, as a player only ages at the rate of one year per 20
playing hours, and even the shortest lived races, such as half orcs, can live
to be sixty or seventy years old.

0 half-elf~

Half-Elves are born of a relationship between a Human and Elf. They are
usualy slightly larger than Elves, though not quite as larger as some of the
larger Humans of the land. Like Half-Ogres, but to a smaller extent,
Half-Elves can have difficulty finding their place among either of their
parent cultures, and because of this many tend to walk a more
loner-orientated path. They retain the ability to see in the infrared
spectrum like their Elven parents, but do not gain any other of their
inherent abilities. 
~
~
0 half-ogre~

Half-Ogres are a result of breeding between Human and Ogre parents. For
the most part these relationships are non-consensual and usualy involve an
Ogre male and Human female. Because of this the Half-Ogre offspring are
often shunned by both races and have a hard time finding there place in the
world. They are significantly larger than the average human, usualy topping
out at eight or nine feet in height, and typicaly with a larger frame to
match. Due to this size, they excell at inflicting a larger than usual
amount of damage, and are very proficient at using their bulk to slam their
opponents about. 
~
~
0 Duergar~

Duergar are a race of Dwarves which split off from their above-ground
brethren many centuries ago. Shunning the light, they instead chose to make
their home in the Underdark, and in the process set about abanodoning most
of the customs and cultures of their kin. Most Duergar resemble Dwarves in
stature, though their skin pigments vary significantly. Like their surface
kin, they excell at mining, and have full use of the infrared spectrum for
low-light sight. Like any Dwarf, they are prone to fits of rage when angered
in combat, and thus gain free use of the berserk skill.

~
Upro~
0 embalm~

The embalm spell was crafted many centuries ago by an ambitious necromancer who 
wanted more efficiency out of his zombies. Carrying around their corpses turned
out to be much to heavy, so he invented the embalm spell, which does just that
to a corpse, allowing the mage/necromancer in question great ease when transporting
their corpses.
~
~
0 note board unread~

Syntax: note <write/text/to/subject/board/post/clear/list/read/show/catch>

Using the note command, one may post notes to the appropriate, selected board.
To start a note, you simply type: note write. This will open up a new note in
your default board. To edit the text, simply type 'note text' and you will be
placed in the game's default text editor. An ampersand gets you out of the text
editor.

Typing unread/board will show all boards and which ones you have unread notes
on. To switch boards, type board <board name>. To cancel a note in progress,
type note clear or simply done.

You can send notes to imm/immortal or imp/implementor as well. The first will
allow only immortals to see them, the second will allow only the highest level
imms to see them. 

If a board has a lot of notes, you can read the last few of them by typing note
list <##>, ranging 1 to 100. Therefore, typing note list 20, will show the last
20 notes in the board. Note list new will show only new notes in the selected
board. 
 
New: note catch will mark all notes in your current board as read.

known to walk the path of light. They are ebony in skin tone, and usually have

Being a drow gives you the inherent abilities of sneak, magic detection, and

can land critical blows at a higher rate than others.  
~
~
0 stun fist~

Syntax: stunfist <target>
 
The stun fist technique is a powerful tool learned by monks in

-1 half_elf~

Half-elves are the combination of elf and most often human breeding,
though other variations do occur. Half-elves retain most of the elven
wisdom, while inheriting more of the size of their usual human halves.
 
Half-elves, like humans, tend to do fairly well in any class.
~
~
0 half_orc~

Stat Modifiers:

Strength + 1, Wisdom - 1, Constitution + 1, Charisma - 1

Half orcs are the conception of an orc and any other race in Aragond. Most
frequently they share orc heritage with either elven or human, but there have
been plenty of cases otherwise. Half orcs tend to be taller due to their orcish
side, and can reach seven or eight feet in height sometimes.
 
Half orcs live shorter than all the other races due to their genetic differences,
and are not very wise or charismatic. They make excellent fighters, rangers, and
the occasional thief.

-1 gnome~

Stat Modifiers:

Wisdom - 1, Intelligence + 2, Dexterity - 1

Gnomes are close cousins to the dwarves, and are accustomed
to caves, mountains, and underground areas. They generally
have beady eyes and come to anywhere from two to three feet in
height.
 
Gnomes are very sturdy, just like their dwarven cousins, and
as such they receive a bonus to their constitution. They are
also known to be wise beyond most races, and thus their clerics
are known to be powerful. Gnomes are well suited for most any
class save for monk, where they tend to be far too clumsy to be
of any competence.

-1 halfling~

Stat Modifiers:

Strength - 1, Dexterity + 2, Wisdom - 1

Halflings resemble humans in almost every way, with their main difference
being their height. Halflings are on average, about three feet tall, and
tend to be more on the portly side, as they're well known for having six
meals a day.
 
Halflings are very dextrous creatures, and gain a bonus to this statistic,
making them excellent choices for thieves. Halflings are also known to be
fairly decent clerics.

0 MONK~

Primary Stat: {rDexterity{x
2ndary Stat:  {yWisdom{x

Minimum Stats: Dexterity (15), Wisdom (12)

Monks are masters of hand to hand combat, their proficiency at it is
unrivaled among the classes of the world. Relying solely on their bodies for
both attack and defense, they have shunned the use of any physical weapons
whatsoever. They are capable of learning a limited selection of clerical
devotions, but otherwise rely on their intense training to manipulate their
bodies to bend to their will. Constitution, strength, and dexterity are
important attributes for a Monk.

Bards are excellent travelling companions, as they always seem to have a story
to tell! They're also good for parties/groups due to the nature of their magic,
which is centered mostly around being in a group. While bards tend to do just
fine alone, they prefer company and excel when in a group.

0 PALADIN~

Primary Stat: {rConstitution{x
2ndary Stat:  {yWisdom{x

Minimum Stats: Charisma (17), Constitution (10)

Paladins are holy warriors who dabble very slightly in healing magic.
They are very distrusting of sorcery of any kind, if it's source isn't 
from one's deity, and thus tend to have trouble adventuring with wizards.
 
Paladins usually have great charm, strength, constitution, and wisdom, and tend
to be excellent leaders of adventuring groups due to this, though they can be
a little foolhardy at times, almost seeming to have too much faith in their deity.
 
As a paladin, you must be good aligned. If not, you will be drained of your paladin
like abilities and reverted to something resembling a fighter.
 
Paladins have excellent health and tend to be in the forefront of any group.
 
Note: Paladins require at least a 17 charisma.

Rangers are the naturalists of a group. They have excellent tracking abilities,
and usuall tend to be quite fierce in melee combat as well. They can wear fairly
bulky armor (see 'help bulk'), giving them a decent amount of damage resistance,
allowing them to tank in certain instances if necessary.
 
Rangers have a multitude of different skills available, as well as a few spells, making
them a useful addition to any adventuring group.

Druids are nature's clerics. They tend to dwell in the woods more than the
city, and are known to have fairly balanced melee/spell casting abilities.
Druids are naturally wary of wizards, due to the arcane nature of the spells
they cast, usually in opposition of nature's intent.
 
Druids can make excellent healers, damage casters, and even melee competitors.

Bulk is the measure of how heavy the equipment/armor you're wearing is. 
Each character class has limits to how much bulk they can wear, as well as
how bulky the items they wear can be.

Cloth            0-1
Shield           1-4
Plate            3-5
Chainmail        2-4

Legs/Arms        2-4
Waist            1-3
Wrist            1-3
 
Also keep in mind metals like mithril/adamantite are notorious for being lightweight,
and should therefore have a slightly reduced bulk in comparison to other pieces of
armor made from materials such as gold/silver/platinum.

When one has the skill of herbalism, they are more readily able to
identify different plants with meta-magical properties.  Herbalism also

Currently the ireset and nesting combo appears to be buggy.

Syntax: bank <open/deposit/withdraw/statement>
 
Banks are used to store more money than a character can generally carry, but come with
stipulations of their own. Banks charge a small fee for withdrawal, and are prone to
being robbed. However, one's bank account accrues interest with each passing year.
 
Using bank open, if a player has 100 gold, he may open a bank account. With the usage of
bank deposit, one can deposit gold coins into their existing account. The bank withdraw
command allows a player to withdraw coins from their account, with a small surcharge.
And finally, bank statement will show a player what they currently have in the bank.
 
Banking can only be done at the appropriate place, silver cannot be deposited, and one
can only deposit a maximum of fifty thousand gold in their account.

-1 DWARF DWARVES~

Stat Modifiers:

Charisma - 2, Constitution + 1, Strength + 1

Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.  

Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so
are very vulnerable to drowning.  They recieve the berserk skill for free
(if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.
 
Dwarves are known to excel at mining and blacksmithing, and have a natural
affinity for axes and hammers. They also have keen vision in the dark.
~
Upro~
-1 ELF ELVES~

Stat Modifiers:

Wisdom + 1, Constitution - 1

Elves are a shorter version of humans, with a much lighter build. They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.

Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously 
hard to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves recieve the sneak and hiding
automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.
~
Upro~
-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~

Humans are the most prominent race in all of Aragond, and they make up
the majority of intelligent life on the planet. They are generally any-
where from 5 to 7 feet tall, and do not receive bonuses to any stats.
Humans tend to excel in every class, though have none that they are truly
masters of.
~
~
-1 GIANT GIANTS~

Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.

Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,
their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,
due to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for
free. (Only giant warriors recive bash).
~
~
-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~

Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls             The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite'/'help learn')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap')

staves		use of magical staves
wands		use of magical wands

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.

-1 wizard mage~

Primary Stat: {rIntelligence{x

Minimum Stats: Intelligence (10)

Wizards are a potent force within Aragond, though it takes a long time and
quite a bit of dedication for a wizard to become powerful. Spells are not
handed out, and must be found through painstaking adventuring, or learned
through your guild after trust is built and coin is paid.

Wizards have by far the largest array of abilities, due to the massive amount
of spells available to them. They begin with either chilling touch, burning
hands, magic missile, or shocking grasp for a combative spell. Wizards also
begin with a utility spell, either copy, knock, or audible glamor. They can
choose to specialize in a particular element, allowing them to hone their skill
with one element, making their spells of that element stronger and giving them
a slight resistance to the chosen element.

Wizards rely on their intelligence for almost everything involving their class.
They can also only wear armor of the cloth type, and cannot surpass a total
armor bulk of 5. 
~
Upro~
-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~

Primary Stat: {rWisdom{x

Mininum Stats: Wisdom (10)

Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes. Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best
class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

Clerics can wear pliable armor up to 2 bulk per piece, and can have a total
bulk of 15. This gives them reasonable defense in battle, giving them better
ability to heal their group... or themself. 
~
Upro~
-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~

Primary Stat: {rDexterity{x

Minimum Stats: Dexterity (10)

Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes:
~
Upro~
-1 FIGHTER~

Primary Stat: {rStrength{x
2ndary Stat:  {yConstitution{x

Minimum Stats: Strength (10)

Fighters are the melee meat of Aragond. They are usually powerful warriors
and have capability with every weapon available. Fighters have a fairly wide
array of melee and non combat skills, and are the backbone of any adventuring
group. Fighters rely mainly on strength and constitution, though having a good
dexterity score will not hurt. They have no bulk restrictions concerning armor,
and can wear a maximum bulk of 50.
~
Upro~
-1 weapon axe dagger sword flail mace polearm spear staff whip bow crossbow~

Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

axe                 the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
staff               staves, quaterstaffs, bo sticks
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
short sword         short swords, sabers, blades (no more than 3 feet in length)
long sword          long swords, cutlasses, claymores, rapiers (longer than 3 feet in length)
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
bow                 ranged combat with arrows.
crossbow            ranged combat with crossbow bolts.
exotic		the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~
Upro~
-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~

Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~
~
-1 ATTACK~

The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy
rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful
than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and 
thieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group consists of the 
following spells:

demonfire	a powerful, but very evil, spell
dispel evil	torments evil foes
dispel good	calls down unholy power on good creatures
earthquake	brings the power of earth to bear against your foes
flamestrike	sends a column of flame from the heavens
heat metal	heats metal equipment to searing tempatures
ray of truth	sends forth a blinding ray of holy energy
~
~
-1 BEGUILING~

This insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists
of various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.
Only mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of
the following:

calm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room
charm person	turns an enemy into a trusted friend
sleep		puts a foe into enchanted slumber
~
~
-1 BENEDICTIONS~

Benedictions are priestly spells, used to bestow divine favor upon your allies.
They are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only clerics and 
warriors may use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the
following:

bless		bestows divine favor upon the target
calm		if successful, stops all fighting in the room
frenzy		puts the recipient into beserker rage
holy word	aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes
remove curse	removes malevolent magic from players and items
~
~
-1 COMBAT~

Combat in Aragond is round based, and different classes have a base amount
of attacks per round, based on their level, martial ability, dexterity, and
hitroll. Each round you may use a 'mid-rounder', a skill, special ability, or
spell available to you. Each of these has it's own cooldown time and an amount
of time required to use. Some may be used twice per round, while others, one
per three rounds. One must be careful in choosing the abilities they use in
battle, as the many creatures of Aragond have resistances or even immunities to
certain forms of physical or magical damage. Bearing that in mind, many
creatures also have vulnerabilities to these same things, allowing for
strategic options in battle. 
~
Upro~
-1 CREATION~

The creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent
duration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their 
powers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in
this group, which contains these spells:

continual light	creates an eternal light source
create food	produces a nourishing mushroom
create rose	creates a beautiful red rose
create spring	calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground
create water	fills any available container with water
floating disc	creates a floating disc of force perfect for hauling treasure
~
~
-1 CURATIVE~

The curative spells are used to heal various unpleasant conditions that can
befall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.
Curative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.

cure blindness	restored sight to the blind
cure disease	heals the plague
cure poison	removes the harmful effects of poison
~
~
-1 DETECTION~

The detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They
can be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even
scry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors can use 
detection spells.

locate object	finds a specific item
~
~
-1 DRACONIAN~

The Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, 
bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.
Only mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few
of them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.

acid breath	 uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy
fire breath	 calls forth the flames of a red dragon
frost breath	 drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon
gas breath	 suffocates your enemies with poison gas
lightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon 
~
~
-1 ENCHANTMENT~

The enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.
Currently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, 
although more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.

enchant weapon	increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon
enchant armor	increases the protective value of armor
fireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
recharge	restores power to a depleted wand or staff
~
~
-1 ENHANCEMENT~

The enhancement spells improve upon the body's pontential, allowing feats of
superhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful
effects upon the recipient.

giant strength	grants increased strength
haste		doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing
infravision	allows monsters to be seen in the dark
refresh		restores energy to tired adventurers
~
~
-1 HARMFUL~

This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		the most deadly harmful spell
~
~
-1 HEALING~

The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	heals minor wounds
refresh		restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~
~
-1 ILLUSION~

The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,
the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.
Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		turns the target invisible
mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~
~
-1 MALADICTIONS~

Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by any class.

blindess	strikes the target blind
curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal
slow		slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack	
weaken		drains the strength of the target
~
~
-1 PROTECTIVE~

The protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or
physical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
sanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
hostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following 
spells:

armor		provides the target with an extra layer of defense
cancellation	a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends
dispel magic	removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel
fireproof	shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
protection evil	provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures
protection good protects from the attacks of good beings
sanctuary	reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half
shield		puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies
stoneskin	turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost
~
~
-1 TRANSPORTATION~

The transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical
teleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,
which are among the most useful in the game.

fly		allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
gate		transports the caster to the target
nexus		forms a two-way portal to a far off destination
pass door	allows the caster to walk through walls
portal		creates a one-way portal to a destination
summon		transports the target to the caster
teleport	sends the target to a random location
word of recall	transports the caster to safety in Midgaard
~
~
-1 WEATHER~

These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by all classes.

call lightning	summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
control weather	changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
faerie fire	surrounds the target in a glowing aura
faerie fog	reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	sends a bolt of electricity into the target

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~
~
-1 BACKSTAB~

Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves may learn the backstab.
~
~
-1 BASH~

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~
~
-1 BERSERK~

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~
~
-1 DISARM~

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~
~
-1 DODGE~

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~

Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~
~
-1 ENVENOM~

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~
~
-1 hand_to_hand unarmed~

Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Aragond.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~
Upro~
-1 KICK~

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~
~
-1 PARRY~

If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
~
-1 RESCUE~

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~
~
-1 TRIP~

Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~
~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~

The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~
~
-1 LORE~

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~
~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrained adventurer had best
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~
Upro~
-1 PEEK~

The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~

Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~
~
-1 MEDITATION~

This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~
~
-1 STEAL~

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~
~
-1 'DETECT GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~
~
-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~
~
-1 'RECHARGE'~

Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~
~
-1 'DEMONFIRE'~

Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~
~
-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~

Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~
~
-1 'PORTAL'~

Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~
~
-1 'NEXUS'~

Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~
~
-1 'HEAT METAL'~

Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~
~
-1 'HOLY WORD'~

Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~
~
-1 FRENZY~

Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~
~
-1 CALM~

Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~
~
-1 HASTE~

Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~
~
-1 SLOW~

Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~
~
-1 PLAGUE~

Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~
~
-1 'CREATE ROSE'~

Spell Level:  0
Type:         Invocation
Domain:       Creation
Element:      Air

Syntax: cast 'create rose'

With this spell a one may create a rose from thin air, an excellent way to turn
the eye of the fairest elf nearby. 
~
Upro~
-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~

Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~
~
0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~

Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~
~
-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~

Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~
~
-1 FARSIGHT~

Syntax: cast 'farsight'
	cast 'farsight' <direction>

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~
~
-1 MASS HEALING~

Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~
~
-1 'FLOATING DISC'~

Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caser
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~
~
-1 FIREPROOF~

Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~
~
-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~

Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
 
Characters may have up to 15 aliases at one time.
~
Upro~
-1 NEWBIE INFO~

Ah!  Another mortal, seeking adventure. You should go through mudschool
first, to gain experience to face the trials outside. Be sure to practice a
weapon in the guild room, or your stay with us shall be very short indeed. Type
'equipment' to see what your are wielding, 'spells' to see your spells,
'skills' to see your skills, and 'commands' for a list of commands. Help is
available on most commands and abilities.

To see a list of commands, type the word commands. They are organized to give
you an idea of what they do without needing to read a helpfile on them. Some
however, are not so obvious, and have helpfiles which you can read by typing
help <command name>.

-1 LAG~

Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
All checksummed were the compressed files
And the man pages, outdate
Beware the Internet my son,
The noise that hangs, the lag that kills
Beware the Usenet news, and shun the frivolous mud with frills
So took his his mudding client in hand
Longtime the virtual foe he sought
So rested he by the T1s three and paused a while in swap
And as in disk-drive swap he stayed,
The Internet, with lags of fame
Came packetwise through the T1 line
And error-checked as it came
One two one two and through and through, the mudding client went kill -9
He left it dead and with it's core he went a tracing back
And hath thou slain the Internet?
Come to my arms my disk-based bot!
Oh lag-free day, callooh callay, he chortled in his joy
Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
All checksummed were the compressed files

-1 ROM~

ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code. It can
be found on Rehobaom's Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

The New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bugs reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

Bug reports --
    Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will Hongach,
    Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Gary Turkington
    (author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's work on
Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

-1 immortal immort imm~

'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 52
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

52 JOBS~

This is a partial list of what a god of any given level should be doing. It is
not complete yet.

Angels:(52-54)
Angels and higher level gods may not assist mortals directly in any way.  
An Angel's main job is to help with quests (via switch), or possibly run
small quest of their own -- but the rewards should be minimal.

Deities:(55-56)
Deities have two main roles: reimbursement and quest running.  Be skeptical
on reimburses, don't just hand out every piece of gear.  I suggest limiting
reimbursements to 10 items at a time, and make sure that you do not load things
at too high a level (new format items have hard-coded levels, so are not a
problem).  vnum and stat are useful for this.  You can draft Angels to help you
run a quest, and please note that quests should NOT have huge rewards -- the
main point should be to have fun.  Deities have no business trying to enforce
rules -- the most you should do to a player is a NOCHANNEL or similar light
punishment.

Gods:(57-59)
Gods can run quests just like Deities, and it's nice to do reimbursements too.
However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace.  Gods can enforce (but
not create rules), using the various NOTELL-class commands, as well as deny,
purge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!)  Gods are expected
to help make the mud run more smoothly, power trips are strictly verbotten.

Not fufilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion.
~
~
-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~

Player killing and player stealing are allowed to all clan members 
(including loners), provided the victim is is within 8 levels of the
character and is also in a clan.  This will flag you as a "killer" or
"thief", allowing any character to attack, and also provoking action
from the city guard.

52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~

.
                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of ROM **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

~
~
-1 RULES~

These are the rules of Aragond : The Chronicles.  For other matters, use common sense.

1) Player killing and stealing are encouraged, just as much as the roleplay behind it.
However if you abuse it, we will ban/deny at our discretion.

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and
  you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent
  to the implementors.
 
* Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health. If we catch
  you doing it, you will lose half your playing time.

* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
 
* No kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be
done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. Walk softly,
and carry a black stick.
~
~
0 SUICIDE DELETE~

Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
~
0 HEALER~

The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~
~
0 OUTFIT~

The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~
~
-1 CLAN~

Clanning is an important part of Aragond. Each clan has it's own faction,
which each player may earn reputation with. If a player has high reputation
with said clan, he may petition to join it. Sometimes even if the player has
no reputation with said Clan/Faction, they may still join based on their
citizenship rank, in whichever town they hail from.
 
Reputation is gained by completing quests (this is still in implementation) for
a particular town or faction, and sometimes both (quests in Renfall will give you
faction and citizenship points.)
 
Clans have ranks as well, which can be attained through whatever system that
particular clan has set up (player run). 
 
Clans can be chartered via large sums of money to Faction leaders. These prices 
are/will be totally negotiated between players.
 
There are currently no Faction leaders until we go into beta and have a slightly
more stable player base.
 
The game will automatically enter you into the PK system at level 15.
~
~
-1 COUNT~

The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
~
-1 GATE~

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also 
immune to gate, as well as in player who has no summon set.  Clan members 
may not be gated to except by their fellow Clan members.
~
~
-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~

This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the
effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show' command).
~
~
0 quest~

Syntax: quest
Quest <request/abandon/log/complete/info>

 
Quest alone will tell you about the current quest you are on. Quest abandon will abandon the
current quest, quest request will request the next quest in line, and quest complete will
complete the quest if you have met the requirements. You must be at a trainer to use this command,
unless you just type 'quest' with no argument.
~
Upro~
-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~

Human
Elf
Dwarf
Half Orc
Half Elf
Halfling
Gnome
Duergar
Drow
Half Ogre

Different races have different starting statistics, and also different
stat maximums for magic items and training.

Each race also has inherent abilities, as described in their respective helpfiles.
~
Upro~
52 IMOTD~

Welcome Immortal!

You are responsible for following the laws of immortal behavior. These can
be found by typing 'help laws' or 'help commandments'.

* Excessive loading is not allowed, and is grounds for deletion.

* Asking for promotion is grounds for instant deletion.

* Type 'help jobs' to get some idea of what you should be doing.

 [Hit Return to continue]
~
~
-1 GAIN~

The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found. (Currently at recall) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    lists all skills and spells that can be learned (limited by guildrank).
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
 
Gaining new spells and skills does not raise your experience to level.
~
~
52 CLONE~

Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT AUTOALL~

Aragond (ROM) uses various automatic actions to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac   : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpses)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat
autoall   : turns all autos on or off at once
automap   : toggles the minimap.
autotrack : toggles seeing tracks on the ground (ranger only)

Typing a command sets the action, typing it again removes it. Use
autoall on|off to save yourself some keystrokes.
 
See also: {gnosummon{x, {gnoexp{x, {gnofollow{x, and {gcondition{x.
~
Upro~
-1 PRICES PRICE~

New Clan Hall Rooms cost 50 diamonds.
Boosting the mana or healing gains for a room costs 250 diamonds.
Both in the same room costs double.
Making the Healer or Store prices lower costs 1,000 diamonds.
~
~
0 Andora~

Andora (and-or-a) is the goddess of nature, having reign over the planet itself.
Her anger is swift, but her love and devotion sincere and soft. Many of her followers
tend to be druids and rangers.
~
~
0 Aziel~

Aziel represents everything that is the embodiment of discipline. He is a
wise, fair, and just god, and attracts many clerics and monks as his followers.
It is, however, not unknown for druids, rangers, and paladins to be found in
his congregation. 
~
Upro~
0 Daij~

Daij (die-j) is an evil god whose realm of control lies in darkness and deceit.
His only purpose is dealing death, evil, and spreading illness and disease in
the world. His constant opponent is Lirannon.
~
~
0 Lirannon~

Lirannon (leer-anon) is the god of all that is good within the world, and
many of his followers are inherently clerics and paladins. Lirannon is in
a constant struggle with Daij.
~
~
0 Nefyr~

Nefyr (ne-fear) is the god of Chaos, and reigns supreme on causing trouble.
Many lost souls wander towards the light of Nefyr, only to be smited down
by the god in order to preserve chaotic order.
~
~
0 Nelenwe~

Nelenwe is the god of true neutrality, apathy, and ambiguity. Balance of
karma, good and light, and justice are the alma mater of this deity, who
primarily attracts Thieves, Bards, Rangers, and Wizards. 
~
Upro~
0 Omari~

Omari is the all encompassing god of magic throughout the land. He is known
to be quite reclusive, but some have reported communing with him in dire times
of trouble. His followers tend to be exclusively wizards, although some clerics
and even bards have been found in the midst of his gatherings. 
~
Upro~
0 Maelik~

Maelik is a bloodthirsty god who's followers appease him through the
constant strife of battle and bloodshed. A very egotistical god, Maelik
requires much from all of his followers, who tend to be Fighters, Monks, or
Battle Clerics.

Diff = max - min.  Mean is the arithmetic mean.
The values in parenthesis are the the standard merc values.
~
~
0 MANADICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles mana.
The values the server generates for merc-type mobs is

  <level> d 10 + 100

where level is the level of the mobile.
~
~
0 DAMDICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles hitpoints.
Suggested values are:

       50         5d10+25    30       75      53

Mean is the arithmetic mean.  The values in parenthesis are the the
standard merc values.  (Will be put in when there's time to calculate
them...)

~
0 RESETS~

Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

    80        -400     -400     -400    -150

These values are 10 times what you would put in an area file. This
is because the server multiplies what it reads from file with 10.

~
~
0 guild guildranks~

Guild ranks are a class based ranking system that is tied into your guild.
Each character has 'guild points', which they earn by completing guild quests.
Each guild rank requires a certain amount of accumulated guild points, and can
open accessibility to new skills and spells.
 
Some skills cannot be attained without gaining a certain amount of exposure within
one's guild, and even the skill or spell may require some sort of prerequisite in
order to learn.
~
~
0 butcher~

Syntax: butcher <corpse>
 
Using the butcher skill, players are able to create food from
the corpses of their enemies, a self sustaining practice that
can save a lot of money in the long run.
~
~
0 skin skinning~

Syntax: skin <creature>
 
Once you have killed a creature, if you are capable, you
may then skin the corpse, and sell it in certain circles.
~
~
0 scribe scribing~

Syntax: scribe <spell>
 
If you have the scribe skill, you are able to copy spells
out of memory onto a parchment, scroll, or otherwise similar
receptacle. Once you have done this, you can either use it
as a scroll or pass it off to other mages to learn.
 
However, most wizards hoard secrets, and thus charge a hefty
amount for the scribing of any spell, particularly rare and
deadly spells.

        bounty remove <player>

a player's head, effectively marking them for death.
You can specify how much bounty you wish to place on

To collect a bounty you must bring the head of the target
to a known bounty collector.

in your primary class. Once you have this prerequisite,
head to your trainer and type mclass without an argument.
You will then get a list of options that you can multi
class into. From there simply type mclass <class>, and your
trainer will charge you a fee, then teach you the basics of
whatever secondary class you chose.

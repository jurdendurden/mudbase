His large calloused hands are stained from working with the
harsh reagents to cure and tan the leathers he works with. Bright

peer across the counter as he awaits your banking needs. Special
antiviolence wards protect his bank from any foolish threats so he
is usually unconcerned about any funny business in his bank. His one
wish would be to move the bank to a more suitable location away from
the rowdy pub across the way but that is a matter for another time.

his musics have attempted to draw attention to the plight of the
downtrodden in the blighted southern sector of Renfall. Unfortunately
this has drawn the ire of those in power within the city, hence his
less then stellar place in the community at the moment.

A haughty noble, his hair pulled back into a tight greasy
bun saunters down the streets of the city. His polished features
are spotless, his aloof demeanour one of casual arrogance. He is
a man who seems to have the world at his fingertips and the wealth
to do as he pleases. He keeps his head held high as he goes about
his business virtually ignoring all those of lesser stature around
him.

Renfall Chapter of Fighters~
The Renfall Chapter of Fighters is housed in a large warehouse type
building, one large open area spreads out in all directions allowing plenty
of room for those in training.  The ground is firmly packed earth, proper
footing is always a prerequistie in any type of combat training.  The walls
are adorned with many practice shields and weapons for those to use in their
training.  The local trainer keeps a watchful eye over the students trying
to prevent any accidental injury or death.

housed in a squat square building to the east. The rounded cobblestones
of Gilded Way see a steady stream of traffic as the citizens of Renfall
go about their daily affairs.

The Renfall Weaponry Shop is a cluttered treasure trove of implements
of destructive goodness. Highly polished weapons of all shapes and
sizes adorn the four walls displayed with loving care. The proprietor
of the shop take great pride in her weapons and her loving care is
evident in the way the shop is arranged. Most of her weapons are custom
made and highly coveted by the discening shoppers in the region.

clean glass display cases are loaded with all manner of sugary goodness.
The Renfall Bakery is a favorite local stop in the city by young and old
alike.

few potted plants and some scenic oil landscapes along its otherwise

intervals bathing the foyer in a dim but comforting light. A small
neatly written sign hangs at eye level on the near wall listing the
services the guild has to offer.

majority of the plain floor adding just the right touch of
opulence to the spartan office. A battered wooden desk faces
a large double-bay window to the west. A stuffed trophy of
a giant stag hangs on the far wall staring into oblivion with
frozen eyes.

guild who all take turns attending to the small shop.

Crossroads of Renfall~
The wide oval crossroads of Renfall is the true heart of the
city. Gilded Road passes through the crossroads running a straight
path to the opposite city walls. A large stone ramp to the north leads
upwards to the gleaming temple of the gods. The distinctive top of the
wizard's tower juts above the surrounding buildings not far to the
southwest. The reassuring burble of water in the fountain to the south
leads into the less affluent section of the city.

The rounded cobblestones of Gilded Road progress through
the heart of the city past tidy homes and small shops. The 
forge glows brightly through the windows of the smithery to
the north. The smokestack of the smithery releases large grey
plumes of smoke into the open air above the building. The
soot from the smithery covers the neighboring building with its
constant release of grimy residue.

Renfall Smithery~
The forge of the smithery grows brightly, heavy smoke billowing up a
copper stack into the stone fireplace of the building.  A grimy alkaline
taste coats the air, another byproduct of the forging process.  Large racks
hold the various armored wares the smithery has to offer at a quite
affordable price for the cost conscious shopper.  Even in times of peace,
any traveller in the area would be foolhardy to journey far without the
proper protection.

its unfortunate proximity to the soot spewing smithery. A sticky soot
covers the elm and the surrounding buildings. A passing breeze carries
the soot off into the atmosphere furthering its ecological impact on
the city.

Grimy soot from the nearby smithery coats the square windows of
the shop to the south. The unpleasant mixture of sulphur and brimstone
emanate sharply from a cracked window of the shop. No doubt this is the
alchemical process at work in the creation of the potions the shop
provides to the public. An odd feeling of static energy grips the area
making ones hair stand on end.

Renfall Alchemist Shop~
Malevolent odors foul the air of the shop making breathing quite
a chore. An open door at the back of the shop releases the pungent
odors out into the main area of the shop. The walls of the shop are
lined with numerous shelves bearing all manner of vials, philtres and
other products of the alchemical process. Due to recent city ordinances
however, most items of a magical nature are under strict control and
distribution. The many guilds in the city are wary about free distribution
to the untrained public, therefore only the most minor of magical items are
sold outside the guilds.

the crossroads of the city just to the east. A short walk to the
south leads towards Rove Street which runs a similar path as its
neighboring street to the north. The western gatehouse leading out of
the city stands just to the north of here in a squat stone structure.

Western Gatehouse of Renfall~
The western gatehouse of Renfall is a tall stone and wood
structure that houses the large iron gate leading out of the
city. A complicated series of large steel chains and enormous stone
counterbalances occupies the majority of the gatehouse. In times of
crisis, the mechanism that opens and closes the large gate can be
activated at a moments notice. Currently the gate is kept open and
access to the city is freely granted. One of the main roads through
Renfall is clearly visible outside the gatehouse.

Western Road~
Western Road follows the high stone perimeter wall protecting
the city of Renfall. Comprised of broad stone blocks and weathered
mortar, the outer walls have stood for generations through times of
great turmoil as well as peace. The road is primarily an access route
for the city and there is little of commercial or residential interest
along it. Rove Avenue begins directly to the south of here running a
straight path through the city to the eastern walls.

The high outer wall of Renfall casts a long shadow down upon
the narrow Western Road. Rove Avenue leads off to the east running
off the far eastern outer wall of the city. Primarily an access route,
there is little of commerical or residential interest along its narrow
stretch. The high rounded top of the wizard's tower is barely visible
over the surrounding buildings on Rove Avenue from this angle.

The high outer stone wall of the city extends long shadows down

way. This section of the road begins to enter the less fortunate
section of the city were crime is more prevalent and caution would be
advisable.

Western Road~
The high profile of the outer stone walls of Renfall cast dark shadows
down apon the narrow environs of Western Road.  Thralt Street begins to the
east leading into the heart of the seedier side of Renfall.  The buildings
facing Western Road are dingier and appear to be much older then those of
the northern section of the city.  Thralt Street is one of the oldest
streets in Renfall, once one of its main areas of commerce in the city.

Thralt Street is lined with dilipidated buildings and raucous pubs that the

area has become a victim of the city's expansion and rebuilding process. Now
forgotten and neglected, Thralt Street and the surrounding alleyways have
become a haven for the criminally inclined.

crooked cobblestones underneath.  Piles of refuse are heaped high in front
of the building to the north crawling with plump rodents.  The idea that
someone might actually be living in such poor conditions is not the most
heartening.

An abandoned building~
Piles of rubbage are piled high on the rotting floorboards of the room
amidst broken glass and cobwebs. Whatever furniture was in the room lies
scattered across it now like wreckage from a sinking ship. Dim light
from the boarded up windows casts long daggers of illumination through
the dusty darkness. Creaking floorboards sound in the distance ahead
indicating that there may indeed be someone or something moving about
in the darkness.

Thralt Street~
A steady stream of down on your luck characters parades into
the busy pub to the north of here. The Griffon Pub is one of the
old mainstays on the street dating back many years. One of the few
buildings that are still relatively intact, the pub is one of the
only flourishing businesses on the blighted street. The backrooms of
the pub are rumored to be of particular interest to those of the less
lawfully inclined.

Round oak tables are placed about the pub encircled by weathered chairs
and stools. Oil lamps are hung from the faded pine walls providing pools of
light in the otherwise dark atmosphere of the pub. Sawdust on the floor
serves to soak up the errant spills from the careless patrons. Conversation
is subdued in the pub as shady characters mingle with the less fortunate
citizens of the city.

A rounded oval of a room marks the foyer to the insular Thieves' Guild of
Renfall. The location of the guild is a loosely known secret around the
city. As long as proper discretion is used in their activites, the guild is
usually not bothered by the authorities. A series of faded oil paintings
line the otherwise plain room. A glass door to the north leads to the
master's office while a curtain on the west wall allows entry to the guild
shop.

The office of the guild master is an exercise in extravagant opulence. An

maps and piles of scrolls scattered about it. A plush velvet chair fit for a
member of royalty is tucked behind the desk. A thick crimson colored rug of
rare velveteen covers the wood floor. The walls are lined with glass cases
filled with rare and exotic artifacts acquired throughout the existence of
the guild. The rank of guild master apparently has its privileges indeed.

A cracked and broken ivory fountain stands forlornly at the center
of Thralt Street. Once one of the main intersections of the city, time
and civil expansion has left this section of the city neglected and
forsaken. Trash and broken wine bottles now fill the once proud fountain,
just another sad reminder of how far this section of the city has fallen.
Many citizens tend to avoid this section of the city altogether preferring 
the more upscale northern sector of Renfall.

The walls which still lean at an odd angle are composed of old
discarded boards from the nearby buildings cobbled together over time.
The worn stone floor is neat and free of any debris except for some
scattered papers. A feeling of wellness fills the shanty, almost one
of hope and perhaps freedom amidst the squalor of the alleyway. The
disgraced master bard of Renfall calls this place home.

new militia recruits to practice their techniques apon. Actual
armed combat is frowned apon in this room and is strictly punished
if new recruits are found to be harming each other. A series of
blunt training daggers have been placed in a weapon rack along the
far wall for training purposes.

Stone Ramp to the Temple~
A wide stone ramp leads upwards from the crossroads towards
the temple of the gods. Comprised of sturdy bleached white stone,
the ramp is designed to handle the heavy foot traffic from the
pious citizens. The majority of the wealthy noblemen hold large
estates in the temple district of the city far away from the
bustle of the city life. Far off to the north the twin turrets of
the castle rise on the distant horizon.

Rove Avenue~
The rounded cobblestones of Rove Avenue end at Western Road a
stones throw from here. Tidy shops and homes skirt the avenue leading
to the far eastern wall of the city. This section of Renfall is
calm and well maintained. Vigilant guards patrol at regular intervals
enforcing the laws of the city. Crime is still a way of life in the city,
one never knows what may lurk around the next corner.

Rove Avenue~
The rounded cobblestones of Rove Avenue are lined with small tidy shops
and scattered houses.  A large oak door stands ajar to the north leading
into the Renfall Mercantile.  Directly opposite the mercantile a narrow set
of stairs lead up towards an oval shaped tower.  An odd emanation of magical
energy seems to encase the tower in its unseen grasp.

Renfall Mercantile~
The interior of the Renfall Mercantile is a cramped affair cluttered with
towering heaps of merchandise and assorted junk. The walls are a dreary oak
lined with drooping shelves covered with items of interest. Most of their items
are of low quality but the occasional bargain has been known to show up from
time to time. A fat calico cat slinks down a shelf on the western wall and
disappears into the shadows at the back of the mercantile.

Before the Tower of Sorcery~
A giant stone door leads into the slightly unnerving Tower of Sorcery. 
Home to all aspiring mages those of other walks of life are not welcomed
within its secretive environs.  The guildmaster of the tower has set up
magical wards to prevent those deemed unworthy of its knowledge any further
entrance from this point.

The foyer of the tower~
The foyer of the tower is a large oval area encompassing the first floor
of the tower.  An ethereal orb floats at eye level depicting the services
the tower provides to it students.  A quick glimpse at the orb will provide
directions to the newly initiated.  A somber silence grips the foyer broken
by the discharge of errant magical energies from the floor below.  A cast
iron staircase winds down to the ground floor of the tower set apon the far
western wall.  An open doorway lies directly to the north and a similar
staircase climbs upward on the eastern wall.

Magical Sparring~
A large open area occupies the ground level of the tower set aside for
the training of the new students of the magical arts.  It is here a new
student can train their new cantrips on suitable opponents with little real
risk of injury.  This is also to prevent the uneducated eye from studying
the combat maneuveurs of the students thus learning the inner workings of
the arcane arts.

A long wooden counter fills the southern edge of the room flanked by
towering bookcases.  Colorful vials and potions fill the numerous shelves
encircling the store.  The mage emporium is open to all mages in good
standing for the guild catering in the mundane and the esoteric.  Most items
are minorly enchanted, little more then simple parlour tricks.  The prices
are fairly affordable however for that budding magic' user's budget.

An enormous oak desk dominates an otherwise spartan office enviroment.  A
plush leather seat sits askew behind the desk pushed against the far wall. 
A wide lone window allows sunlight into the room depending on the time and
weather showing a panoramic view of Renfall below.  A stack of paperwork
threatens to topple off one end of the desk strategically placed oddly
enough above a large metal can.  A battered paper map on the western wall of
the office seems to have seen much use over the years.

The enormous oak desk appears to be quite old and has seen much abuse. 
The once glossy surface of the desk is marred by numerous scorch marks and
careless rings from beverages hot and cold.  Large lumps of candlewax from
uneven blobs across its once proud exterior.  A stack of paperwork threatens
to leap off the edge of the desk into a large metal trash can placed beside
the desk.

map~
The map appears to be of the nearby region surrounding the city of
Renfall.  Several concentric red circles have been placed about the map
perhaps pointing to areas of interest or concern for the guild.  Perhaps
some discreet inquiries about the map with the guildmaster may be in order.

Rounded cobblestones neatly swept and maintained wind their way past trim
houses and tidy shops.  A large oval tower sends a long shadow down apon the
street just off to the west.  The gentle burble of a nearby fountain sounds
softly to the east.  A slight breeze stirs the limbs of a nearby tree
sending a soft cascade of leafy debris down to the ground below.

far to the west.  Directly to the east a tall obsidian fountain burbles
quietly in the central square of the city.  The overall vibe of the city is
one of prosperity and general safety at least in this section of Renfall.

A large gleaming fountain of pure obsidian dominates the center of the
city here. Gleaming copper pipes feed the fountain providing fresh
clear water for all to partake. Polished wooden benches circle the
perimeter of the fountain provided by the local chamber of commerce. A
stream of mixed races filter past the fountain dealing with their daily
affairs. Many pause briefly to fill their containers from the fountain
before continuing onward about their business.

Rounded cobblestones line the wide expanses of Grabel Street leading
towards the eastern half of the city.  A large obsidian fountain towers
directly to the west in the center of Renfall.  Uniformly built houses and
shops line the tidy street in close proximity to their neighbors.  The acrid
scent of tanning reagents filter down the street from the local leathershop.

A two story wooden and stone building lists to the side off of Grabel
Street housing the local leathershop.  The acrid odors of tanning reagents
fouls the air around the shop.  A grimy leather sign has been bolted to one
side of the open doorway looking like it has seen much better days.  The
wooden facade of the building is pitted and corroded attesting to the
acidity of the reagents used within the shop.

The grimy shop is cluttered with various mannequins clad in the different
leather outfits available for sale.  A tall wooden counter tucked towards
the back of the store is flanked by several stretching racks.  A large mound
of fresh hides are piled on the floor next to the racks awaiting curing and
stretching.  The air is foul inside the shop and difficult to breathe.  The
tanning reagents used to treat and cure the animal hides is no doubt toxic
and probably harmful to ones' health over a long period of time.

casting a dark shadow over its smaller neighbors.  A scraggly alley cat
slinks by and darts off down the street.

its neighbor across the street is an squat austere building housing the
local bank. Local law enforcers have been known to frequent this area
due to the local troublemakers spilling out of the bar and off into the
neighborhood. The high stone wall just a short walk away marks the eastern
perimeter of Renfall.

with animal trophies and other unmentionable stains.  The warped flooring
underfoot is covered with a fine straw to absorb the numerous spilled ales
as well as bodily fluids no doubt.  Many a brawl has been broken up in the
pub and no doubt there will be many more to follow.

there are no guards visible.  A wide low wooden counter stands against the
far wall manned by the banker on duty.  If you have the gold opening an

Gilded Road runs a leisurely route past shops and guild houses that
inhabit the city. The atmosphere in this part of Renfall is one of
prosperity and well being. The working class citizenry mingle freely
will well-heeled nobles with little visibile acrimony. The division of
wealth in the city seems to be fairly balanced. The squat gatehouse for
the eastern gate rises directly to the north.

Eastern Gatehouse of Renfall~
The eastern gatehouse of Renfall is a tall stone and wood
structure that houses the large iron gate leading out of the
city. A complicated series of large steel chains and enormous stone
counterbalances occupies the majority of the gatehouse. In times of
crisis, the mechanism that opens and closes the large gate can be
activated at a moments notice. Currently the gate is kept open and
access to the city is freely granted. One of the main roads through
Renfall is clearly visible outside the gatehouse.

metal over that of the stealthy thief or the more piously inclined paladins.

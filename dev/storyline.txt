Many millennia ago, when humans first discovered their abilities to space travel, they began an extensive (and expensive) quest to colonize other planets, galaxies and star systems. Their technology was limited, and it was quickly realized that in order to branch out further than the known Solar System, a new type of fuel or energy would be required to power their ships faster and farther.

After a few decades of research and inhumane experimentation, humans were able to produce a new element from molecular combinations of plutonium, xenon, and hydrogen. This new chemical had the atomic power of a 300-ton atom bomb, but non of the explosive properties, making it extremely favorable as a fuel type. The drawback, however, was that it's half-life was incredibly short, and the fumes it exuded were extremely toxic to anything living on earth.

After many more years of research and development, it was decided that the new fuel was a viable alternative, provided that it was never used within Earth's atmosphere. A craft was created to transport ANOTHER craft to the GHST (galatic human space station, or commonly called 'ghost'). The transportee was a new ship designed to use the new fuel, and this mission was successful.

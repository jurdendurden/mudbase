Hey man noticed this today.. loaded Bara up to test some progs
he couldn't seem to see any exits? So deleted him and created
another test char.. same problem? Im char's seem to be fine.. they
see the exits with no problem. Its not a light factor either tested
Bara with a light before deleting em. Kinda odd all of a sudden.
Maybe something with new forage code? Thought you should know.

Hey man how goes the weekend. Anyway I think i mentioned
this bug before. For some reason when you go to edit progs or
add new progs to mobs.. they all stop working lol. Not sure
what the deal is with that. . I could have sworn you caught/
fixed that one while back. Anyhoo thought you should know.
Peace

Trying to track this down but having issues and as such I will have to
continue looking. It's a more obscure bug but I should be able to figure
it out soon enough.

Disconnected from server.
 
 
I'm assuming since he "died" and is still fighting, it
caused a crash.

Subject Newbie Store~
Text
Weiland and myself believe we have solved the problem
with the store in the newbie arena.
1)  He is holding the honeybun that doesn't have any
wear flag.
2) He is then trying to sell that object from his hands
causing a crash.
3) We both decided it must have something to do with
the autowear for the random equipment code.

There is a simple room description I found that is
clearly inaccurate...
A broken down ivory fountain beckons just to the east in.........
the fountain is clearly to the west. :D
It's on Thralt Street and east of that broken fountain

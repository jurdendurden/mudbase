So if you are fighting something and make it bleed, it will bleed out and you get no exp if it dies from bleeding.

* converted all resistances/vulnerabilities over to a table, for more flexibility. now there
  can be varying degrees of resistance/vulnerability to different types of damage.
  You can type vuln/resist to see your personal list (this used to be the table command).
* fixed a bug that would allow you to endlessly kill yourself for unlimited pkills/pdeaths.

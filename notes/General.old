Ok when I was removing junk for donation pits I commented
out some very important code that's been looping us ever
since when you try to get something out of a corpse,
(basically autoloot was getting the item, then you would
get the item again, but the item didn't technically exist,
so the game would be like WTFM8?!?11.)
 
Anyway that's fixed now, and on to bigger and better things.

Subject engage and skill pre-requisites.~
Text
We now have the engage skill. This allows you to engage other people in
combat than the current person you are tanking. This will be VERY useful
for group tactics in the future when fighting bosses with 'adds' and such.
 
On that note, I've added in skill pre-requisites and base_stats.
 
What this means is that most advanced skills will require you to know a basic
version of that skill. A good example of this will be combat tactics.
This skill will be required for everything from dirt kicking, to parrying, to
engaging.
 
Secondly, the base_stats is run just like ad&d, where each skill relies on it's
base stat. Example being sneak, which relies on dexterity. You will see more of
this in effect in the future, but for now, love it, live it, and as always, enjoy!

Possible to limit clan names to a certain length? or make them ( ) all same length.
Having different length clan names throws the do_who appearance off.

then the clan leader could make a help file for the clan itself "help loner" so
only the symbol was used for the do_who part.

Hidden is simple, if it's hidden, players without detect hidden (or thieves with detect secret)
will not be able to see it. It become un-hidden once it's picked up. If it's hidden, you'll
see red ()'s around it. Adding functionality to the current 'hide' command to hide objects.
This will be reliant on sector (ie. unable to hide objects on a road,
but easy to do in a city/forest.)

The game will now only let you set materials to items that exist in the
materials table I have devised.
 
What this means is that there will be no objects made of 'scrotum' or any
such nonsense (Had to deal with this on one mud). This also means, if the
item is a piece of armor, it will be automagically set with a bulk that is
appropriate to the material being used.
 
Later additions will include the inability to allow armors to be made from
gems, weapons made from cloth, and other such weirdness. For now use common
sense. Also, it's ugly, but typing material ? in the oediter will show you
a list of available material types.

Text
Mining is complete. You must have a mining tool of some sort to mine.
You must be in an appropriate area to mine. You must type 'material'
to see which materials you have dug up. You must have lots of moves
to mine, otherwise you're not gonna mine up a bunch. Being a dwarf helps.
Type mine to start mining, mine stop to stop mining.
 
Enjoy!

Subject casting as a non caster~
Text
Immortals, multiclassers, and the world alike, this is fixed.
It took some double, triple, and quadruple checking of the code,
but I finally figured out where the hell I made my mistake at.
 
You can now successfully (or not depending) cast spells as a none
mage/cleric.
 
My god this was a bug from hell but it basically boiled down to the
code trying to check whether a single/multi class person could cast
a spell regardless of whether their second class was a caster or not.
 
Anyway to make a long story short and make my night easier, it's fixed.
 
I think I'm going to go have a shot. :P

Text
I have overhauled the entire system. It's a helluva lot smarter now
than the first time I wrote it. Basically now it also ties into the
materials table, and can assign materials based on the item it makes.
 
Also, bulk is assigned based on material, the name generator has been
uber spiffied up, (which also ties in with the weapon mods I made).
Weapons now will drop as a certain TYPE of weapon, not just exotic,
and as such, will have names like, sword, dagger, dirk, etc... based
on their type. weapon averages have been looked at and tweaked, and
we should also no longer have issues with the sword of BLANK. If you
DO happen to see an item drop with no suffix descriptor, please let me
know so I can bang my head against a wall. :P

Text
Those two areas are from greed gold 1.0 which is a pretty sophisticated base that
has a completely different area saving function than what we use. Unfortunately it's
so different that editting the areas by hand would take a week or more....
 
I found an envy2rom converter but it's for an older version of Envy that doesn't have
things like Keyed entries and the act flags saved as their appropriate names (rather
than as a single letter reference).
 
I really would like to use these areas but at this point I'm out of options unless I
either a) rewrite our whole area saving/loading functions, or b) hand edit those two
areas (which will become VERY tedious.)

bug fixes:

you can't write notes while in combat (which crashes the mud)
some fixes to the random item generator.
 
damage system changes:
each damage type has it's own descriptive word and ending modifier. This means maces pound,
swords slash, etc... They also have color coded damages. Try it out it's quite nice.
This idea was taken from a mud I previously played on and while I tried to make it original,
I found the way they did it was quite exquisite, so just rolled with that.

Subject bleeding, healing, and regen rates.~
Text
OLC will now auto-assign a low-ish number to both heal/mana rates each time you create a room.
 
The heal code was WTFFUBAR. I don't know what they were thinking when they created Rom/Quickmud,
but that shit made no sense. Anyway it's fixed, and this is how it works:
 
1. Game checks your con (for hp), wis/int (for mana). Adds to heal rate based on this.
2. Checks for sleeping/resting/fighting divides by 2/6 for resting fighting.
3. Checks if you're hungry or thirsty. Divides in half if you are.
4. Adds point for point from the rooms heal/mana rate, SO don't over do it on this. Avg regen rates
   per room should be 20-30ish I would think, but we can always discuss and change this as necessary
.s
5. I hate this editor.
6. It checks poison/plague/Haste/Slow and divides by 4/8/2/2 respectively.
7. Then you get your gain.
 
Bleeding should now slow on it's own every tick. (Unless you're just gushing blood.)

Kinda light on the code work today.. sorry for that lot of other stuff
going on right now.
 
Got quests beefed up a bit. They have level ranges, indexes, and can be
made repeatable, as well as can be assigned a specific mob to complete it
at.
 
Also new command quest list... lists all quests in your range.
 
Also put in summon monster. You need a monster heart to cast it. It's not
finished but works fine, just need to make a way for casters to have to
"bind" the monster once summoned.
 
Enjoy

For example: a wizard/cleric. wizard max bulk = 5, cleric = 15.
Your new max bulk would be 10 (5+15/2), however, you COULD wear
2 bulk items (ie cleric).
 
Also identify will now show you if a light is eternal or not.

Movement is done by 'sail east/west/etc'.
You can also drop anchor using the anchor command (anchor lower/raise).
Disembark will get you off the boat once you've docked.
DO NOT try to use goto/snoop/etc.. while someone is on a boat or YOU are
on a boat. Things get a little screwy if you do.

Ships are now complete. Changes since last note include:

players that don't own it, now actually move with the ship.
you can now SEE the ship if it's in the same room as you (ie docks, etc.)
aedit now has a 'shiploc' command to set a ship's starting vnum.
and some other general things to make it more... realistic?
 
At any rate. It all works now. Ships will each be their own area.
Builders, when you make a ship, the first vnum MUST be the deck, AND
MUST be set to whoever owns the boat (via the owner command in redit).
There's also an area flag (ship) that you'll need to set, and we'll be
doing ALL ships under the 99k vnum range.
 
Most ships will be 10 rooms or so, but players who buy big ass ships will
get upwards of... oh i dunno, 30 rooms.
 
Look for cannons, ship damage, cargo, and other fun stuff
to follow suit very soon.

disintegrate spell, fun for all ages.
 
the new spell goes with... spec_beholder. A new spec to place
on beholder mobs. It's smarter than the old spec_mage/spec_cleric
crap, in that it checks for immunities before using certain eyestalks,
and also checks to see if someone is already affected by a spell before
using it.
 
This is a SMALL taste of the AI I will be pumping into the specs to come
, as in spec_boss, spec_elite, etc... I want to give our mobs some combat
intuitiveness so they aren't so damn easy to kill :)
 
Also made heal/cure crit reduce bleeding, as it crossed my mind while
testing the spec_beholder.

i'll slowly be adding things like wind speed, temperature, etc..
which will open up a WORLD of things I've been wanting to do for

[    3   Human    Fighter ] }^\v/^{ Ragnar this is my title
That is an example of instead of a clan name a symbol instead.
Could be other things up to whatever you set for max_length.
-,--`-@  or what not.  including color codes, so you would need a color_strlen for it.

A covering flag to place hidden/secret objects under others.
"You look under the rug and find the key!" That type of thing.
Maybe even a hidden/secret flag for actual loaded objects. Not
an invis one.. tried that person without detect invis can't see
the object properly. Ireset doesn't like nested objects within
others either btw.. caused crash earlier today. Container resets
in particular don't carry over to hotboot/reboot either for some
reason. A few object types.. salves.. that you apply for different
benefits. A few others i can't think of atm ill try and come up with
some more.

Subject Player shops~
Text
Had kind of an odd idea while messing with a portal. What if
players could have a custom portal to a shop that they could
stock and control.. and that they could move around like they
wanted to? Within reason of course to prevent littering all
over the place. Might be kind of an interesting selling point
for the pbase. The portal would need some type of owner/keepsake
flag of course to prevent people from snagging/moving it.

Subject Midgaard Rewrite~
Text
Hey just took a quick walk around Midgaard. The rundown of
the vnums are kind of a mess. there not really sequential, they
tend to kind just run all over the place. This is a pretty messy
way to run an area especially one with such a large chunk of vnums.
Removing midgaard.. you'd have to rekey the numbers in the merc.h
to whatever really. could rekey them to all one number even. recall
etc. I was able to do this in smaug before as well as envy so its
not that difficult. If it were me I'd rekey them to maybe 1000 for
now until rewrites are in place. That way you could free up those
vnums. In the long run once you get a good chunk of areas together
its nice if all the numbers are sequential and flow together. Easier
to avoid mistakes that way or someone screwing up another area by
accident. Anyway going to relax a bit I'll be back around tomorrow
and maybe we can chat a bit more there or thru email whatever's easy.
Have a good night.

Subject Started Renfall.. few snags~
Text
Hey man hope work went ok. Started running thru a few rooms for
Renfall starting at 1k. Hope i read your earlier note right lol.. anyway
few snags I ran into. Coupla crashes i caused. one was screwed up reset
which i fixed.. another one was a mob that i forgot to set the hit/mana etc
dice for. I'm missing purge/slay so tried to just kill the mob which resulted
in another crash. One good thing is the autoreboot seems to work great. Another
type thing to keep 
.s
.s
.h
.c
lol hate this editor too short. I seem to lack the olist/rlist type
thing to keep track of rooms objects or i'm screwing up the syntax
for it. Otherwise no real issues with the olc cept for my clumsiness
with it. Oh mprogs seem to be the only things in too.. doesn't seem
to be rprog/oprogs. Sorry about the earlier crashes hope you didn't
have any unsaved work in progress. So far i setup a mage guild.. and
the groundwork for just the main drag through town. Maybe i'll catch
you later on in the weekend and update you easier that way. Have a 
good night.

Before you could only olist/mlist/etc... from redit. This is
fixed. This editor is going to be a thing of the past soon.
Crashing with 0/0 hp/mana... I'll have to look into that.
 
You should now be able to purge/slay. They were set to level
54, but I see no reason a level 53 builder can't use them.
 
The area itself looks great so far! On second though, think
i'm going to put you to 55, that should give you some better
commands and such to tinker with.
 
As for oprogs/rprogs, I'll look into that as well. Could have
sworn those were already built in.
 
Anyway, have a good one!

Hey Boss hope things are going good. area is coming along..
Ranger Guild in with armor shop coupla others i forget already.
Anyhoo I think I mentioned the .f in the majority of the editors is
either set too high.. default is usually 80 or so. The room descripts
in particular tend to scrawl all over the damn place after the .f .
Newer editors crop at whatever the default is set too. so makes it 
easier to keep things uniform. A minor bitch but it' ends up giving
everything a kind of half-assed look otherwise. Oh wordwrap is another
function for it i think its called. Anyway real minor like i said,
something else i meant to mention but can't think of at this time. Oh

Subject notes/board/unread~
Text
When I was coding ships, I added a 'board' command to get on the ship.
Now it's thrown off the note system, so in place of it I put the 'unread'
command so if you need to change boards to check old notes 'unread general'
and the like will work.

Subject green hills~
Text
I've begun porting over the green hills area by copy/pasting.
Currently I'm skipping the mprogs, just adding all the main
items of interest (and going in sequential order, which is
why there are only mobs done so far.)
 
I have assigned both of us to the area so if you'd like to copy paste 
with me a bit here and there that'd be awesome, so we can get this
thing up and in the game. We'll do the same thing with ebonshear once
we're done here.
 
Unfortunately this is the quickest way I can think of for us to
just both copy/paste in what we can here and there, which shouldn't
take TOO long with both of us.
 
I figure we can re-add the mprogs once we're done as well.

I've opened a copy of the mud on port 8177. This is intended to
be used for testing of anything that could possibly crash us.
 
There's no need to use it now, but in the future if there are players on,
multiple builders working, or something along those lines, that's pretty
much when you'd want to use this port.
 
All your chars exist on this port already and notes written on each
port can be seen on the other, (although not until a reboot/copyover).

Hey man started banging on greenhills.are.. got it up to 20.
I don't mind doing a quick rewrite of it.. its pretty easy and
not as draining as trying to flesh out a city. Ill dump out the
rooms and tweak it here/there. Nrenfall et al. is pretty much done
until progs can be ironed out. Both the renfall's still need a good
walkthru for bugs/typo's etc. It's easier for people who don't know
the area to spot them then my blurry eyes lol. I mixed up the structure
of the rooms a bit so far in the greenhills.are just to make it seem
fresher. I'll keep the xp mobs around 3-5 for easy grinding. Ebonshear..
the one off it was supposed to be a bit higher but doesn't matter to me
really either way.

Hey man coupla things katago picked up on. Bleed works
but kind of difficult to cure without the bandage skill.
I did up a bandage which ill add to some of the shops so 
people can pick them up. He had died awhile back an lost
all his gear so i helped him out a little. That brought to
mind maybe a newbie kit for certain levels.. maybe make the
cutoff 8 or so. Anyway he also mentioned.. at level 6 he had
tnl of something crazy .. like 30mil or so lol. Maybe he read
it wrong not sure. The other thing he mentioned an i checked with
a mort was the heal regen rate. Maybe an aedit.. an area flag that
would set health rates.. right now it defaults at 1 per room looks
like.. even set at 150.. it only ticks off 2 or 3 points per min or
so roughly. Not sure if its keyed to con check or not in the rom.
I know the smaug has that built into the race file i think.. the regen
rate.. also the class plays a lesser role. Might be acting up not sure.
Anyway the areset worked nice. i spread the mobs around a lil more in
renfall. .need to work on the others areas now so the mobs aren't all
bundled together too much. Talk to ya.

Text
I just explored ebonshear to get a feel for placement and I see exactly where you
are on it. It's looking good by the way :) Anyway kril started his area off at a
landing by a rocky shoreline so I'm going to put it pretty much directly south of
renfall. That will put greenhills/ebon sw of ren, mosgha east/north, the farm
village far east, and his area far south.
 
It actually works out well that he did that because I began an ocean area and I'll
just put it directly south of his area (south of the south continent). I figure we
can flesh out the continent in no time if we can get this guy Toxis to join us full
time as well (he's been poking around a couple of days now). With 4 of us building
it shouldn't take long to flesh out a few more areas and open up for public play (in
extreme alpha)
 
Again let me know what you think
